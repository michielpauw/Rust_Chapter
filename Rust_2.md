## Concurrency

Concurrency can improve performance. But problems may also arise. For example:

- Race conditions, where threads are accessing data or resources in an inconsistent order
- Deadlocks, where two threads are waiting for each other to finish using a resource the other thread has, preventing both threads from continuing
- Bugs that happen only in certain situations and are hard to reproduce and fix reliably

## Still to cover

- Testing
- Functional programming: iterators and closures
- Macros
- Pattern matching
